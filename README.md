# Call Cost Analyzer

The Call Cost Analyzer is a Jupyter Notebook project that calculates and tracks the cost of phone calls based on different time periods. It helps users analyze their phone call expenses and provides a breakdown of costs for different call categories.

## Features

- Allows users to select the time period of the phone call (daytime, evening, or off-peak).
- Calculates the cost of each call based on the selected time period and call duration.
- Tracks the total call duration and cost for each time period.
- Provides a summary of call categories, call durations, and total costs.
- Ensures inputs are valid and prevents negative call durations.
- Offers a user-friendly interface for easy interaction.

## Prerequisites

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.x
